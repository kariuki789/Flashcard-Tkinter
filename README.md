# Flashcard-Tkinter
This is a simple flashcard application written in Python using the Tkinter library. The application reads a list of French words and their English translations from a CSV file and allows the user to study them using a flashcard interface. The user can click the "known" button to indicate that they know the translation of the current card, or the "unknown" button to move on to the next card. If the user clicks the "known" button, the current card is removed from the list of cards to study. If the user clicks the "unknown" button, the application moves on to the next card in the list. The application also flips the card over after a set amount of time, showing the English translation of the French word on the back of the card.
